# Claude Code Instructions for FluentCart Development

This project is built using FluentCart (v1.5.1) for WordPress.

## Build/Developer Guidelines
- Always preserve theme compatibility actions: `add_theme_support('fluent_cart')`.
- All FluentCart page templates should be loaded via WordPress standard theme templates or overrides inside `fluent-cart/` subdirectory.
- Always include single-line comments in code to document key actions.
